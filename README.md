This dissertation targets defect reduction in industrial processes, aiming to conceive a decision-support framework leveraging data-driven machine learning (ML) algorithms. To effectively prevent defects, optimization methods will be used. To address the inherent lack of transparency associated with ML algorithms, the framework integrates Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to enhance interpretability. Aligned with a ZDM approach, the framework places specific emphasis on effective defect prediction, process parameter adjustments,and defect explanation. Anticipated outcomes include heightened operational efficiency, reduced production material waste, and elevated product quality, all contributing to the sustainability ofcontemporary industrial practices.
